## EventBus — the global signal hub (TDD §2: "signal-driven decoupling").
##
## Systems emit and connect to signals here instead of holding hard references
## to each other, so the dive layer, exposure system, UI, audio, and telemetry
## stay independent and testable. Nothing in here holds state — it is pure wiring.
